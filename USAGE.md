# Louis Front-end

## Introduction

Louis Front-end is a conversational web interface that serves as the gateway to Louis backend. This project aims to provide users with a seamless and interactive experience when accessing the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) or related topics through a conversational interface.

## Usage

This application features a user-friendly interface that primarily revolves around a chat-like search bar. Users can engage in conversations or ask questions about the CFIA or any relevant topics. Additionally, they are presented with a curated list of 9 example questions, which serve as prompts for initiating conversations with the agency's conversational web interface.

Upon asking a question or selecting one of the example questions, users are taken into a dynamic and intuitive chat-style interface. Here, they can view the questions they have asked and the subsequent responses from the back-end server. The responses are displayed in a visually appealing response block UI, which includes possible citations for the answers.

To gain deeper insights into the answers, users can click on the lightbulb icon, which reveals the thought process behind the response. Furthermore, they can click on the clipboard icon to access supporting content related to the answer.

In certain cases, the application may present users with follow-up questions or prompts to further refine their queries and provide more accurate responses.

### Navigation and Features

The application includes a header that prominently displays the CFIA banner. Clicking on the banner conveniently directs users to the official inspection.canada.ca website, ensuring easy access to additional resources and information.

Adjacent to the header, the application's name is presented in both English and French: "Louis, CFIA's Virtual Assistant | Louis, l'assistant virtuel de l'ACIA." This demonstrates the bilingual nature of the application, catering to users in both official languages of Canada.

To the right of the header, users will notice an "Alpha Version" tag, indicating that the application is currently in its alpha stage of development. This serves as a reminder that the application is still undergoing improvements and enhancements.
